We choose 5 cities for our analysis. They are New York, Washington D.C, Chicago, San Francisco, and Boston.
Our analysis period of the data is from 2021-03 to 2022-03.
Because of the change of the column names and data file names and the amount of data to process (currently, we process over 15 million rows of data), we don't choose to analyze the data for a long period, like 5 years period.

### Project structure

1. Run **request_data.py**
- request bike data and covid data, except for the covid data of Boston and Washington D.C. (They have dynamic urls when we want to request to download the data, so we provide these two files.)
- process and merge the bike data into one dataframe
- process and merge the covid data into one dataframe
- process and merge the weather data into one dataframe (The weather data file can not be requested to download because the website has a download limit, one account only can download two files, so we provide the weather data files.)
2. Run **analysis_hypothesis.py**
- Get the results and plots of our hypo1 ~ hypo3.

### Dataset Sample

Take an example from one city (Boston)

#### Bikeshare data

#### Covid data

#### Weather data

<img width="1512" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63156187/167223203-b7f1b3be-5608-4390-bef5-0f749a32daba.png">


### Hypothesis 1:
#### Users prefer to use shared bikes in summer rather than spring, autumn and winter.
First, we create a plot of each city's total shared bike usage quarterly.

- (Jan-Mar: Q1)
- (Apr-Jun: Q2)
- (July-Sep: Q3)
- (Oct-Dec: Q4)

![bike_trend](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63156187/166621514-9686a4d4-a6b1-457e-a3e0-c81d43dfa1d9.png)

We can see that in each city, the bike usage in Q3 is higher than others. The plots support our hypothesis. Therefore, the usage of shared bikes in Summer is greater than other seasons. But why?
Then we conduct a deeper analysis in daily weather dimension.

![Boston-weather](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63156187/166621435-95065a67-5720-45a2-9f43-ade0a60dac55.png)
![Chicago-weather](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63156187/166621452-13fff0eb-8094-4ba3-ade7-82bf4d00ddbb.png)
![NYC-weather](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63156187/166621477-80c991a7-9222-421b-b57b-fb6a826accb0.png)
![SFO-weather](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63156187/166621485-de165260-0c51-4451-8ca3-7890c0171e46.png)
![Washington-weather](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63156187/166621493-356f8032-0382-42ef-a967-0146293d0558.png)

Here are some plots of the daily weather of each city and its total shared bike usage in 4 quarters. The blue bar represents clear-day, lavender one represents partly-cloudy day, pink one represents cloudy day, the steelblue one represents rainy day, the aquamarine represents the snow day and the green one is windy day.

We find that the reason why users prefer to use shared bikes in summer is because of the weather because in each city, the proportion of good weather is greater in Q3. However, the proportion of rainy days is also higher in some cities, so we need to do further analysis to figure out that Do people still travel a lot on rainy days?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63156187/166620698-11933f0a-54a8-4e21-bb30-8de42772603d.png)

From the plot above, we can see that in Q3, although people uses the shared bike a lot in good weather, the usage of shared bike in rainy days is still higher in these cities. Therefore, the weather factor may not be the primary factor of affecting the total usage of shared bike.


### Hypothesis 2:
#### The effect of COVID-19 pandemic on bike share is greater in eastern cities than middle or western cities in US.
We choose some representitive cities in the eastern, middle, and western areas of the United States.
First, we focus on the overall comparison between each city's total shared-bike rides and their covid cases.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63156187/166604759-370eee6d-9185-4cd4-b261-9e0023894be0.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63156187/166606119-d141a16c-1021-41d7-9c68-d3bbfceb8acd.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63156187/166606138-fe741e75-6185-4f70-a156-055f5e355b0e.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63156187/166606152-ea78feec-e9ca-4373-8110-61a4d03cc954.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63156187/166606220-712be286-f577-478b-b079-5bac9bb65c6d.png)

The cities we choose may be the representatives in the eastern, middle, and western areas of the United States. 
Letâ€™s look on the overall comparison between each city's total usage shared-bike and their covid cases. The time period of analysis is from March 2021 to March 2022. We can see that the growth of usage of shared bike in these cities can not match the decrease of the covid cases in these cities from these turning points. So there may be meaningless to study the relationship between these cities. Thus our hypothesis may not be accepted.

However, in Washington D.C, the growth of usage of shared bikes may match with the decrease of the covid cases. The trend of bike usage and the trend of covid cases may have a relationship or correlation. 
But there are many other factors, maybe this is a coincidence. So, we raise up ***a new hypothesis***. We need to do further analysis on Washington D.C.

#### New Hypothesis: In Washington D.C, the covid cases may not affect the usage of shared bikes. 

And we decide to use a scatter plot to see the correlations and use correlation coefficients to determine whether there a relationship is.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63156187/166606707-7dc59afa-c00e-4ef1-8ecb-592d01cbe16b.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63156187/166606751-e0d36f33-739f-4fa5-9469-8c0a0074e075.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63156187/166606781-2f140a99-d4e9-41e5-a745-9c31d098f4f8.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63156187/166606814-aa6e4053-ba19-45fd-8a72-1d5305bead97.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63156187/166606859-8748df01-830b-4e36-aea3-0dc03b0b8e01.png)

Then we use the Pearson method to calculate the correlation coefficients and use linear regression to demonstrate that.

The correlation coefficients are:

|            |   Boston    |      NYC      |      Chicago      |      SFO      |      Washington D.C      |
|------------|:-----------:|--------------:|------------------:|--------------:|-------------------------:|
| Correlation Coefficients |  -0.085123    | -0.360768         | -0.529725     | -0.339701    | -0.814073 |

We use linear regression to demonstrate the correlation.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63156187/166609155-18eb01b4-ee52-4d9d-98c6-3ebc9d757c24.png)

R-squared: 0.662715
P-value: 0.0012688629650304379

From above, we see that the correlation coefficient is -0.81 which means there is a strong negative correlation of covid cases and total usage of shared bike in Washington D.C. And the R-squared is about 0.66 and p-value is 0.001 after we do the linear regression. So in this case, in Washington D.C, the increase of covid cases will decrease the usage of shared bike. So we reject our new hypothesis and accept that the covid cases will affect the usage of shared bikes in Washington D.C.


### Hypothesis 3:
#### Members prefer using bike share than casual member(non-member) when distance between start and destination is less than 1 miles and trip duration is less than 15 minutes in these cities.

We will use five cities including **Boston, Washton D.C, Chicago, San Francisco, New York** to test our hypothesis. In these five cities, the bikeshare companies have two category users which are member and casual.
The following pictures display the distribution of the member and casual users

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48091236/166553482-75db77a2-57f4-4757-a2fa-cb88b50ad542.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48091236/166553541-110c5256-b227-411f-b174-2023381c118f.png)

Improving the user conversion rate in Boston is hard because the proportion of casual is relatively smaller and stable than in other cities.
The city of Chicago, New York, and Washington D.C have a similar trend. The number of users has fluctuations based on temperature and the proportion of casual users is almost half of their total users.
San Francisco is considered a Mediterranean climate, so the fluctuations are not obvious compared with other cities. The proportion of casual users is almost half of their total users.

To further analysis the trip duration and distance in different cities and user's category, we explore and clean data to keep duration and distance data in a range that show their distribution.

**overall, the most trip duration is lasting about 20 minutes, and members are more willing to hava a shorter trip compared with casual user.**

***overall, the distribution bwtween members and casual members for trip Distance is similar.***

Sum up the difference between members and casual users behavior in trip duration and distance, we calculate mean in five different cities.

***Conclusion:*** members and casual members have simialr trip distance, but members' trip duration time is shorter than casual users. Members prefer using bike share than casual member(non-member) when trip duration is about 10 minutes in these cities.
