### Hypothesis 1:

Users prefer to use shared bicycles in spring and summer rather than autumn and winter.
 
### Hypothesis 2:

The effect of COVID-19 pandemic on bike share is greater in Eastern US than Western US.

### Hypothesis 3:

More members use bike share than non-member when distance between start and destination is less than 2 miles and trip duration is less than 10 minutes in these cities.
